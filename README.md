# pymportx
`pymportx` is a Python package designed for fast gene count estimation using transcript quantification files generated by pseudoalignment or quasi-mapping tools. It is a Python adaptation of the widely-used [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) R package from Bioconductor.

## Example
```python
from pymport import salmon

results = read_salmon(salmon_folder_paths,
                      tx_out=False,
                      tx2gene=tx2gene_file_path,
                      countsFromAbundance='no')
```
